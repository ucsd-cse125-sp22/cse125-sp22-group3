## Project Description
Have you ever wanted to trade stonks in an adorable farming game while sabotaging your friends? Well thats Farmers Market.
Don't be fooled by the game's friendly graphics, it is a friendship destroyer. The idea is simple: Plant , grow, and harvest
vegetables and sell your crops for money. However, beware. You're racing to see you can make $20 first. Your friends are
allowed to stop you with any means necessary: This means stealing, vandalising, and even poisoning your crops. Its a battle
to build a corporate vegetable empire with beautiful graphics.

## Group Management
Decisions will be made as a team through voting. Communication will be through Slack, Zoom, and inperson. A project timeline
will be made and followed to make sure everyone is on track. Meeting times will be during class (Tues. Thurs. @ 9:30) and
Wed. & Sat. @ 5-7PM

## Project Development
We've divided our group into 7 core components each with a component Lead: <br/>
**Gameplay/Level design**: Danica <br/>
**Networking**: Nick<br/>
**Art**: Cher<br/>
**Graphics**: Cynthia<br/>
**Integration testing**: Jennie<br/>
**Game Logic/Physics**: Leon<br/>
**Audio**: Jakob<br/>
Ofcourse everyone is allowed to work on any other part of the game, but component leads will keep track of and document progress.
Everyone is responsible for testing and making sure their components are working.<br/>
Every component lead will do documentation<br/>
Visual Studio, C++ / JetBrains Rider, OpenGL will be used<br/>
